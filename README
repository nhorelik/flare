======

The FLARE model is an old, outdated, but fast technique for 
core physics calculations.  This implementation is for
2-d calculations, mostly in support of poropy, the 
educational reactor physics optimization toolkit.

We provide a Fortran 90 code for which the user can write
simple text inputs.  Alternatively, all the modules can be
accessed in Python via use of f2py (which must be installed). 

To build the executable, 

>> make flare

To build the python module

>> make pyflare
